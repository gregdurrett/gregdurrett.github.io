<h1>Attending Conferences</h1>

<p>You have three main goals in attending conferences (ordered by importance):

<ol>
<li>Give a good talk/poster presentation
<li>Network and learn about what others are doing
<li>Promote your work 
</ol>

<p>The first point is self-explanatory: your presentation is going to get lots of eyeballs on it and it's really important that it be high quality.

<p><b>Misc:</b> Start a group chat with other students and leverage each others' interactions. Someone got invited to a cool lunch? Try to bring a couple others along.
Not so easy if you're traveling in a big group of 5-10 but at least a few people can do this.

<p>Take notes on interactions as you have them. This way you can remember names and ideas that came up.

<p><b>Networking:</b> Your next goal should be to build connections and interact with people. A really good icebreaker question is, "what are you working on / what
are you presenting here?" Get them talking about their work and try to engage them with questions about it. This will help you gain fluency in a wide range of areas
and build a broad understanding of NLP. If you've already read someone's paper, you can definitely approach them and say that you liked
it and maybe ask a question or two; most people will be thrilled by this.

<p>Another good question is "what cool stuff have you seen here?" Especially if they're from a big lab, they might tell you about other neat things
you can check out. This is a good way to find out about papers that are generating buzz; we want to know about these.

<p>Don't try to force your work on other people, but as part of interacting with them, hopefully they will reciprocate and ask what you do.
You should probably have a 30-second summary of what you're doing prepared. Beyond this, many
students you talk to won't know enough about your area to ask meaningful questions, so the conversation about your work may be brief. That's okay, just
let it drop and don't force more information on them. If they do ask more questions, you can explain in more detail.

<p><b>Approaching people:</b> <b>Don't hang out in a big group of just UT students!</b> The idea is to talk to <b>new</b> people! Most of the time, if you see groups
of students milling around, you can crash them and introduce yourselves. You can also leverage each other: if you see another UT student talking to a group
of others, you can walk up and join the group. If you meet people in this way, by time you're at your third or fourth conference, you will probably find that
you know a good number of people from previous conferences, having read people's papers, internships, etc., and then meeting new folks comes more naturally.

<p>You can really feel free to approach lots of different people. As long as you don't trap people and let them leave if they want (if they excuse
themselves to get coffee or something), you'll be fine. Also, you shouldn't try to force your way into a group of folks who may be having a semi-private conversation
(e.g., two faculty members talking in a corner who maybe have a long history together). If there are particular faculty you'd like to meet, I can try
to introduce you at some point throughout the conference.

<p><b>Setting up meetings:</b> If there's someone you really want to talk to, consider emailing them in advance of the conference to ask if they'll be there
and see if you can set up a meeting. You can use this for other researchers/PhD students working in your same area, potential internship hosts, or potential PhD advisors (if you're an undergrad
or MS student).
