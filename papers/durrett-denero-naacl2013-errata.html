<h2>Errata for "Supervised Learning of Complete Morphological Paradigms"</h2>

<p>The paper posted here differs slightly from the one in the ACL anthology.
After submitting the camera-ready copy, we discovered that our Finnish nouns
dataset also contained adjectives, due to incorrect assumptions we made when
scraping Wiktionary. The paper and accompanying dataset are updated to reflect
that our evaluation condition is over both Finnish nouns and adjectives
simultaneously. Beyond this modification, the results and their interpretation
are unchanged. </p>
